Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve

You got me f*cked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kind of stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kinda find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'?

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy, I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, goin' over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault

Instead it's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster is all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me? Boy
I don't understand
No, I don't understand

END

[Cam'ron (J. Cole):]
Killa, it's The Off-Season
Let's keep it tall, y'all ain't f*ckin' with my man
And don't check your watch, you know the time
Cole World, Killa Cam', niggas is f*ckin' finished (Yeah)

[J. Cole:]
This shit too easy for me now
Nigga, Cole been goin' plat' since back when CDs was around
What you sold, I tripled that, I can't believe these f*ckin' clowns
Look how everybody clappin' when your thirty-song album do a measly hundred thou'
If I'm bettin' on myself, then I'll completely double down
If you hated on a nigga, please don't greet me with a pound
I be stayin' out the way, but if the beef do come around
Could put a M right on your head, you Luigi brother now
Trace my steps all in this game, you could see we cover ground
Back and forth from NC to New York when Jeezy had the crown
Vivid memories, niggas start to squeeze, we duckin' down
So many shells left on the ground, it make the Easter Bunny proud
I get up, dust my clothes off, sleep is the cousin of death
No plans to doze off, the streets, it don't come with a ref
I never sold soft, just creeped where the hustlers crept
And got they O's off, you reach, niggas uppin' like Steph
To blow your nose off, gesundheit, and then resume flight
As if it never happened, shit we witnessed full of so much sickness
Angels sheddin' tears in Heaven, word to Eric Clapton
Off this clever rapping, bitch, my pockets gon' forever fatten

They gon' forever fatten
[Cam'ron:]
See, we tried to tell niggas
They act like they don't even f*ckin' speak English

[J. Cole:]
Bitch, my pen to the paper's lethal
I'm sendin' 'em straight to meet the
The nigga that made them peep the reaper
Creepin' on ya, the scent of failure reekin' on ya
Check your genitalia, pussy-niggas bleedin' on yourself
F*ckin' with Cole is bold, but it's impedin' on your health
All yo' niggas eatin' off your wealth
All my niggas feedin' all they selves, and it feels swell
Krispy Kreme dreams, sometime my dawgs wanna kill twelve (Uh)
'Cause they steady harassin'
We seen dilemmas like Nelly and Kelly that end in the deadliest fashion
My young niggas nutty, they blastin'
Bullets be hummin' like Cudi but one of yo' hoodies Spaghetti-O splashin'
All over the driveway, y'all talkin' all sideways
Shots poppin' off, y'all laid down
Cops chalkin' off y'all legs now
(Shit) God watchin', "Hey, Yahweh"
My niggas looked up to the sky like we sendin' it y'all way (Y'all way)
We sendin' it y'all way (Y'all way)

[Cam'ron:]
That's what the f*ck I'm talkin' 'bout
Y'all see what the f*ck goin' on out here (Killa, Harlem)
I-95 shit, Carolina, 2-6, stand up, nigga

F*ck you and your mom
And your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
F*ck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all f*ck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends askin' questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you
But I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through
So let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
F*ck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all f*ck off

Na-na-na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E F you

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you
But I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through
So let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your Craigslist couch
And the way your voice sounds
F*ck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all f*ck off

Na-na-na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E F off
Na-na-na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E F you

And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
F*ck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all f*ck off

END

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

END

Am I the only one here tonight
Shakin' my head and thinkin' somethin' ain't right
Is it just me? Am I losin' my mind?
Am I standin' on the edge of the end of time?
Am I the only one? Tell me I'm not
Who thinks they're takin' all the good we got
And turnin' it bad, hell, I'll be damned
I think I'm turnin' into my old man

Am I the only one, willin' to bleed
Or take a bullet for bein' free
Screamin', "What the f*ck" at my TV
For tellin' me, yeah, are you tellin' me?
That I'm the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you
Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone

Am I the only one not brainwashed?
Makin' my way through the land of the lost
Who still gives a shit and worries 'bout his kids
As they try to undo all the things he did?

Am I the only one who can't take no more
Screamin', "If you don't like it, there's the f*ckin' door"
This ain't the freedom we've been fightin' for
It was somethin' more, yeah, it was somethin' more
Am I the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you
Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone

I'm not the only one
I can't be the only one

Am I the only one who quits singin' along
Every time they play a Springsteen song?

Am I the only one sittin' here
Still holdin' on, holdin' back my tears
For the ones who paid with the lives they gave
God bless the U.S.A
I'm not the only one, willin' to fight
For my love of the red and white
And the blue, burnin' on the ground
Another statue comin' down in a town near you
Watchin' the threads of Old Glory come undone

I'm not the only one
I can't be the only one

Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know

That you are the only one I'll ever love

Forever's not enough time to
Love you the way that I want (love you the way that I want)
'Cause every morning I find you
I fear the day that I don't

Falling out, in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which-which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy)

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it)
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la-la, like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back to them all
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind (true)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

Ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Falling over everything to reach the first-time spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was looking for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two
It's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)
My bad habits lead to you (ooh)

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights ending alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearing this will be the last but it probably won't
I've got nothing left to lose, or use, or do

Tried to get away from me, had a stand off
Hit em in the spine, knock his dreads off

Thuggin' in my Reebok's, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh- I heard he shot, Draco make a beat box
Og made dat sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Out of mind, Draco make 'em beat box

In Miami with my muhf*ckin' heat out
Another nigga bitch said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big goon shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sensе
Oh, he the plug, riding round with four bricks
Call me Kobе, twenty-four on me
Can't f*ck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you needed to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, now I got her taking off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan 'til they got my kicks on
And I'mma hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless

[SpotEmGottem & Pooh Shiesty]
Bur-Bur-Burn away a carbon beam, knocked yo legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a stand off
Hit em in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reebok's, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh- I heard he shot, Draco make a beat box
Og made dat sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Out of mind, Draco make 'em beat box (Brr-brr)

[Pooh Shiesty]
I'm strapped up wit' the jug, one in the head already be cocked

I hit the auto switch and made it twerk and while he dump the Glock (Brr, brr)
Got the drop on all his spot, he get robbed if he go or not
I know the taste love wock, he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped

Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls Truck when I'm pulling up
And I still ain't check the time up on my Cartier, just hold it up (Brr)
Don't come around acting gangster, we call your bluff (Brr, brr)

Had a mask, Draco make 'em beatbox

[Adam Levine:]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

[Megan Thee Stallion:]
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dream it, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go and it would end, so

Any time I need you, let me go, ya
Any time I feed you, get me low
Any time I see you, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you, hey ye, ratatata

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
To put your loving hand out darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man but I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
What about 'em, why da basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for da need to replace me?
Ya' on a runway track from the good
I wanna paint in the pictures any way we could, react
Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it till you took it back
But I keep walkin' on
Keep rockin' dawns
Keep walking forward
Now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own (hold my own)
Just can't make it all alone (all alone)
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a con about to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out darlin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out

I hit her phone with the tea, like, "Bitch, guess what?

In our bag, bust some bands every time we link up

A 40 HP Johnson
On a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns
Barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn
And freshly cut corn fields
One arm out the window
And one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together
And probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar
If it ain't got no strings
Or pouring your heart into a song
That you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven
Like good ole boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet
When we go out downtown
Your lipstick stained every coffee cup
That I got in this house
The way you say I love you, too
Is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right in to mine
Like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together
And probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar
If it ain't got no strings
Or pouring your heart into a song
That you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven
Like good ole boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together
And probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise
Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this old guitar
If it ain't got no strings
Or pouring your heart into a song
That you ain't gonna sing
It's a match made up in heaven
Like good ole boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

And me, as long as you're right here

[Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin' her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don't mean
And you know

[Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said she that saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, "You don't have to join in," she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

[Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

[Lil Durk]
They town just told me, "Don't trust 'em"
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

[Morgan Wallen]
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone

[Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

[Morgan Wallen]
There's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Leave them Broadway girls alone

"I want it to be like, messy"

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me, and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I, if not exploited

And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my f*cking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth", I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah-ah
-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)

(She's having a really good time)

Got a broken ego, broken heart
And God, I don't even know where to start

Could never come back and my family straight (Grrah)

Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a f*ckin' parade
Old jealous-ass niggas tryna f*ck up my pay (Ha)

This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherf*cker plain (Woah)

Five nights up, still poppin' and ragin'
The SVR still livin' deranged (Yeah)
I want her, she wanted the same
Hit 'em both same time, both glad that they came (It's lit)
Keep me a vibe, but can't keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep 'em in training (Oh)
Tat' a logo on the back of my brain
Don't ask me what the f*ck am I thinkin'
Back of these walls, I'm full of that drank
Eric came through with a little entertainment (It's lit)
Area 29, got it lookin' like space
Houston, it's a problem way we bustin' up faces and shit
I came with the snakes, no squids (Straight up)
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin' the fest', I see it
She lovin' the fest' (Straight up, straight up)
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body
In lace, I know you lovin' Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, I'll drop you a pin to a time and a place (Wait)

Rockin' her bed and the headboard

Earthquake, make somethin' shake, my love
Most of them can't even relate, my love
Used to be gang, oh, now you're not gang
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to catch flights but now I'm not playin'
Play on words, she love it when a nigga sing
I ain't tryna play your game no more

We are not a thing, can't take no more
Waitin' on your king, you could wait some more

Funny how this shit just flipped like a quarter
Get a new thing, I'ma Fendi and Dior her
Get a mood swing, I'll be gone by tomorrow

I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a way, the only words I know that you

I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, f*ck evaluation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Oli got the first edition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from those guys
I'm tryna just relate what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that I hide still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels (the only words I know that you)
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the (until I, until I)

I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a way, the only words I know that you

Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows
Supposedly something else is controlling me
Under our pictures lives some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my Tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I gotta scale the love back 'cause

I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean

Yeah, oh
Heavy day, for real
Yeah
Yeah

The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even RIP and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me is fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How can anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the f- do we manage to win everything but awards?
Windows of opportunity let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say "Pardon me" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well this is perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

I love you, I love you, I love you
(What you mean to me)
I need to make you, ooh

Always catch me when I'm not that strong

You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream
One spoon for two
And trading jackets
Laughing 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Being annoying
Singing in harmony
I bet she's bragging
To all her friends, saying you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her
Almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest
We kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type

I'll bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singing it together
Now I bet you even tell her
How you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (ooh) (I love you)

So when you gonna tell her
That we did that, too?
She thinks it's special
But it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Oh
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're trading jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
(I know you get déjà vu)

(I know you get déjà vu)

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still f*ckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still f*ckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
That probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosy
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be f*ckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be or couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I still see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep on us anymore, it's with security

I'm outside (yeah), twenty-nine (yeah), G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

I don't understand why you blame me
Take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm tryin')
Senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see (outside)

Rollin' in a Rolls and ain't no safety
Ridin', engine revvin'
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs, downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
You can hear them raw sounds when I rock, I make you sleep (oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in a harmony (sick)
Worry, sick, I'm sick of worryin' (sick, sick)
It's just a worryin', I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (yeah)
Early mornin' shoulder rubs and lawyers, I done sell a bean (it's lit)
I'm never settlin' in, this shit get darker than my melanin (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Del Mar, that's the beach where my ho was but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (yeah)
Purple demon face, won't push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I make an expense, to me it's just sense
I'm droppin' the top, no tint for the whip
I'm droppin' the top, this bitch tryna spend
She droppin' the top, she back again
F*ck her 'cause she at the crib again, company (yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (ooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh), I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (oh, oh)

And I'm outside (ah-ah, ah-ah), twenty-nine, G5 (ah-ah, ah-ah), seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (ah-ah, ah)
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (oh, oh)
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see
Up on a mountain (up on a mountain)
Search through the valley (search through the valley)
You hear me calling (you hear me calling)
Won't you come find me? (Won't you come find me?)
Please don't forsake me (please don't forsake me)
All of a sudden (all of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (breaking)
I feel it coming, I, I

Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's

Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeak-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (ayy)

My new clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without Skoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keeping some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine and her up-do goes down

Ayy

Jump in that- (Hah, Hah), summon that bitch
Jump in that- (Hah, hah), jump in that fire (Hah), jump in that bitch
Hittin' that fire, jump in that whip, thumbin' that bitch
Cum in that bitch (Ho), drummin' that- (Hah, hah)
Drummin' that bitch (Yeah)

[Baby Keem]
Choppa doin' circles, it's a Bird, Bird
Take him to the party, he's a nerd (Pop out)
I see niggas hit corners in the motherf*ckin' 'burbs, huh (Pop out)
Done politickin' with the competition, what's the word? (Yeah)
Put that on my mama, nigga, eight in the process
Niggas tryna tippy-toe through the progress
Tongue-tied when the truth is an object
What's the pros and the cons of this next check?
Wasn't nobody 'round, I was independent
In the '90s, sittin' bum with the windows tinted
Heard a bum got a strap in the party
Who the f*ck let this **** in the party?
Beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up, beat 'em up (Ah)
I was seein' double in the projects
Mad at myself when I put it to the side
Mama had to cater for the coupe
That we rode after school on the way to Popeyes
And niggas wanna play both sides
It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye
It's a headshot, Damien Kane, Woo
Them guys
F*ck around and bury two of them guys
I'm OD in Paris, I'm OD in France
I thought that I told you, I need the advance
Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm f*ckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho

I'm not a trending topic, I'm a prophet
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel
Bitch, looking for a better me
I am a legacy, I come from the seventy
The Al Green offspring, guns and the melody
The big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
Soon as I press that button
Nigga better get right like the ambulance comin'
Us two on a light, Keem been through nothin'
Dave Free got at least one B in the oven
I'm trippin', I'm juugin', my mental is amazing, brother
Pop off, only on occasions, brother
Rich nigga, momma know I made it, brother
Go figure, never caught cases, brother
Face it, brother, gracious brother
New flows comin', be patient, brother
Show my ass and take y'all to class
I can multitask like Megan, brother
2021, I ain't takin' no prisoner
Last year, y'all f*cked up all the listener
Who went platinum? I call that a visitor
Who the f*ck backin' 'em? All been falsified
The facts mean this a vaccine and the game need me to survive
The Elohim, the rebirth
Before you get to the Father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch
Smokin' on top fives
Motherf*ck that album, f*ck that single
Burn that hard drive (Burn that shit)
Ain't nobody safe
When I come up killin' everybody that's outside (Who you with?)
Yeah, Kanye changed his life
But me, I'm still an old-school Gemini (Lil' bitch)
Let me jump in this bitch

[Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Let me jump in this bitch
Two phones, but I only bring one in this bitch
One daughter, but they all my sons in this bitch
No hoes, ain't shit gettin' done in this bitch
I'm scary, I got a gun in this bitch
Smokin' on top fives, stop playin', I'm that guy
Number two DM'ing my bitch
That's cool, I don't ask why

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let your edge out
Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind
Can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me
Choose to watch
While the world break up and fall on me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in good days, good days
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me about my fears, my limitations
I'll disappear, if you let me
Feeling like, yeah (On your own)
Feeling like Jericho
Feeling like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood
Know you like, that shit getting good with it
Baby, baby, heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me
Choose to watch
While the world break up and fall on me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in good days, good days
Always sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I just choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste and our youth is in the present
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it

He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's goin'
And he's proud of where he's from

Nobody does it better

He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles out of town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them folding chairs leanin' way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried about tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Way down here we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', hey y'all
Yeah it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Somethin' 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

There's somethin' 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine (Sippin' apple pie moonshine)

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Good time
Tryna catch a good time
Good time

Yeah we're tryna catch a good time (Good time)
Good time (Good time)
Tryna catch a good time (Good time, baby)
Good time

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me

And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you love me
And think of me fondly when your hand's around her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware
That you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your f*ckin' friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me f*ckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just f*ckin' leave me alone

Ooh
Balloons are deflatin'
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?

No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah

I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?

Of me
'Cause I think of you, think of you

Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me

But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Heat waves been faking me out

Sometimes, all I think about is you

You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you could call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way

Looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on

Tell me everything that you need to say

Midnight 'til morning, call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
Midnight 'til morning, call if you need somebody
I will be there for you

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say

[The Weeknd]
See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't

[Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's only defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah


[The Weeknd & KayCyy]
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know You won't
I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

[Kanye West]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

[The Weeknd]
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Taylor Swift]
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

[Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me

How can one become so bounded
By choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version
Of a person we don't even like?

We're in love with the world
But the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads
That corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child
Every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun
But now I only soak up wine

They say to play hard, you work hard
Find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody
Who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something
You just want me

Why am I obsessing
About the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval
From people I don't even know?

In these crazy times I hope to find
Something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad
But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)

Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
Love you for free (each other for free)
Everybody wants something from me
You just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all
'Cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled
Is a road best left behind (ahh)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)
'Cause everybody wants something from me
You just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm

I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and f*ck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Trippin' 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you
Boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)

Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us

And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (f*ck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (no)
Missionary gettin' borin', can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (no)

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us

Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over (Yeah)

[Jack Harlow]
My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers
Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers

[Lil Nas X]
I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for (I got what they waiting for)
I don't run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from nowhere)
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I'm back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over

[Lil Nas X]
Yeah
I'm the industry baby, mmm

I'm a livin' little good thing
It's like you never lived for me
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good
Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sittin' on top of this shit
This shit can go one or two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah

I be comin' in peace, but f*ck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen your mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood leaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby like surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered a hustle
And makin' the best out the struggle
I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9's like the AR rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
Then in summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold the double disc
Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street
Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Voiceless niggas gettin' murdered every week
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' homie got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60's
Christ went to Heaven aged thirty-three
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey

I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a f*ck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen them lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah

We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you move, uh-oh

But we could be corny, f*ck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, f*ck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you move, uh-oh

Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
F*ckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your-, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (Ah)
Drama make you feel (Ah)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

[Doja Cat, SZA & Both]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh

Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (gang)

Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (yeah, gang)

I'm mister body catcher, Slaughter Gang soul snatcher
Ain't no regular F-150, this a f*ckin' Raptor
No capper, street nigga, not a rapper
Chopper hit him and he turned into a booty clapper
Smith & Wesson, I'm 4L Gang reppin'

And he got the double-R droppy outside
Checked the weather and it's gettin' real oppy outside
I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherf*ckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that f*ckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies

Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me
I come straight up out the 6, and we don't spare sissies

I f*ck with her, and f*ck with her, and her
I hit up err and tell him do the err, for sure
Voodoo curse, it got him while I flew to Turks

And the pastor sang and them bullets sang
And them choppers sang and the choir sang

I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, and my men insane
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

Late at night

Catch me drivin' down 405
Just me and your girl, late at night
Side to side
(Mustard on the beat ho)

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride I'ma ride, ride with you

I can't f*ck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I be all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside I'm a high roller
I been on a global jet but nigga I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick knacks
Fifty racks I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the Bach
I just f*cked off a million but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realist, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' Cat
She know I got the game but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we f*ck, I gotta run it back

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride I'ma ride, ride with you

I told shorty never get too comfortable
I like to feel like the pussy untouchable
I like to feel like it's never goin' one way
I like to see your body drippin' Elliante
I say I like the way I took you on a wave
I had you screamin' my name out

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over
I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to
You better never make no time for these niggas
'Cause when I ride I'ma ride, ride with you

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride

To get you under my pressure
Richer
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' by the Braves
Court room soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count money all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you f*cked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M-O-B (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'

Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I f*cked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sailin' Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
"The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rondo"
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these is where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothaf*ckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, "Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

I caught it bad just today
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwin' smiles at my face
Romantic talking? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to f*ck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't living right

Cocaine and drinking wit' your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way
Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I'll be on the way, like

Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buying
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from f*ckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh-oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I want to f*ck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinking wit' your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way
Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I'll be on the way, (oh) like

Call me by your name
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name
I do not care if you lying

Ayy
You know my ex
So that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts
That you sent to yours but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say)

You walked in my life at 2 AM
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said

Now we're in the back seat of the black car going home
When she asked me, "Is it wrong if I come up with you?"
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all, sounds so true to me
We don't have nothing to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

[J. Cole:]
Oh, you came there, God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Lord
No matter how, no matter how long it take, yeah
No matter how long it take, nigga
Oh, God, yeah
You better be

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (Spiral up)
No fly zone, please stay the f*ck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now they knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see nathin'
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prosper that's formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendys

[Morray & J. Cole:]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

[21 Savage:]
Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhf*cka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with them (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to textin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

[Morray & J. Cole:]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)

Mmh, mmh-mhm

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognize myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Don't you like me?
You know mommy doesn't like
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)
Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, um, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I don't know and I feel
Like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make you go, "Ay, yi, yi"

My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mmh, mmh-mhm

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and, and stuff like that to keep my mind off of it
And I feel like today, I'm home, and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up into a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that
But I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot

Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
Oh, I
Tell me what's changed, is it my status? Is it my fame?
Is it my pockets? Is it my change
Is it my pride? Is it my body?
Back then, "No show, no call" was your motto
Only hit me up after the club and you off that bottle
Pussy so good you thought you hit the lotto

But if I had you back, all I wanna do is f*ck (F*ck)

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah

Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong

Mmh, yeah

Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You could come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Pop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I be on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimes I be wrong

I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hunnid rounds in a double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie and them to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around still, but I still check
I don't got a hunnid mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby f*ckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take real Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I f*ck her with my chains on
And she handle her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partnas, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit

It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started

When the nights get colder
And the rhythm's got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

There's always something that's standing in the way

Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "F*ck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we f*ck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately, I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the f*ck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought

The youngin', six million and runnin'
And I promise to keep it one hundred, keep it one hundred
You see me grindin' and hustlin'
So you got to respect me, f*ck you, give me my check, please (yeah, yeah)

Young and chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)

Hit him with pressure, my niggas won't let up
Tell them niggas to catch up, oh
Wake up, got a million in diamonds that sit on the dresser, oh
Run up that check, now I flexin' my muscles, I feel like a wrestler
'Cause we come from nothin' to Rollies and plaques
Fake love, it was holdin' him back
Flashbacks while you're pourin' the yak
Since a young nigga he just wanted a sack
He used to daydream 'bout thumbin' through racks
Heat tuck, it get cold in the 'Raq
Tears fall while he loadin' the strap
Seen it all, he just wanna relax, uh-uh
I'm richer than I ever been
Put my heart before the bag, worst shit I ever did
Gave you a second chance and you left again (uh)
'Member days I used to wonder, "Would we ever win?"

Young and chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)
A youngin' out that bottom, but he beat the odds (yeah, yeah)

I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

So, I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I'll make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?"
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk
F*ck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to f*ck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', "Free Drizzy"
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit"
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi

[Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me"
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

[Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, wassup? We in this bitch

[Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still f*ck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
F*ck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya"
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green
6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

New contract big like I play ball, lil' boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
I told her, "Pull up," she told me she can't, her nigga be sharin' location
Yeah, I was ridin' in the Ghost with the ghost gun
Seen you out with your kids so you owe one
And my man in the can while you takin' out the trash, he gon' pop with the MAC like, "Don't run" (Don't run)
Gave her a pill, they all get high, you ever had a foursome?
It's too much cash for me to hide, I had to give lil' bro some
I f*ck her raw from time to time, I don't show no emotion
But when he died, he had them racks, he had to make a GoFund
I hang with the hitters who train the killers who send all the niggas on store run
I got me a check and I brought me a 'Cat, and I went on the block and did donuts

Ran it up on accident, they thought it was on purpose
I know for a fact, I'm blastin', man, I never get too worried
Hunnid racks in hunnids, stick like cursive, I been sellin' verses
One time I lied inside my song, I ain't gonna buy her no Birkin
Homicide on my mind when I slide, I ain't tryna see no hearses
He ain't even die by the gun, took a fake pill, nigga died off Percs

Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I just choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste and our youth is in the present
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the t-shirt that I'm wearin'
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's goin'
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him

He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles out of town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them folding chairs leanin' way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried about tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Way down here we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', hey y'all
Yeah it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Somethin' 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Yeah we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

There's somethin' 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine (Sippin' apple pie moonshine)

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me

And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you love me
And think of me fondly when your hand's around her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do
And I'd end up more afraid

Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware
That you made me miserable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your f*ckin' friends

I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me f*ckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends
So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just f*ckin' leave me alone

Ooh
Balloons are deflatin'
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?

No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah

I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head

Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?

Of me
'Cause I think of you, think of you

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually I put
Something on TV
So we never think
About you and me

But today I see
Our reflections
Clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreaming of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out

You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you could call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way

Looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close

Painting stars up on your ceiling

You know you can call me if you need someone

[The Weeknd]
See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know you won't

[Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me to wait to beat the game, it's only defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
She just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah


[The Weeknd & KayCyy]
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know You won't
I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

[Kanye West]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

[The Weeknd]
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons stuck on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Taylor Swift]
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

[Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me

How can one become so bounded
By choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version
Of a person we don't even like?

We're in love with the world
But the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads
That corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child
Every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun
But now I only soak up wine

They say to play hard, you work hard
Find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody
Who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something
You just want me

Why am I obsessing
About the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval
From people I don't even know?

In these crazy times I hope to find
Something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad
But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)

Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
Love you for free (each other for free)
Everybody wants something from me
You just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all
'Cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled
Is a road best left behind (ahh)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love)
Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)
'Cause everybody wants something from me
You just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm

I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and f*ck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Trippin' 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you
Boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)

Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us

And if you wondered if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (f*ck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

Used to be too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (no)
Missionary gettin' borin', can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (no)

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missin' you
Wish it was different than what it was (oh yeah)

And if you wondered if I hate you (f*ck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

I wouldn't mind being alone
I wouldn't keep checking my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losing sleep
Remembering everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doing lately

You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

[Jason Aldean & Carrie Underwood]
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely, getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off
Whenever I want to
If I didn't love you, if I didn't love you

[Carrie Underwood & Jason Aldean]
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (Someone new)
It should be something I can do (I can do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

Yeah You
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely, getting by somehow
Yeah, it would easy be not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off
Whenever I want to
If I didn't love you, if I didn't love you

It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

My track record so clean, they couldn't wait to just bash me
I must be gettin' too flashy, y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (Woo)
It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay and these girls know that I'm nasty (Mmm)
I sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her ass cheek
City talkin', we takin' notes
Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts
Wish he could, but he can't get close
OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts
I'm the type that you can't control, said I would, then I made it so
I don't clear up rumors (Ayy), where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)
I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers
Turned my haters to consumers, I make vets feel like they juniors (Juniors)
Say your time is comin' soon, but just like Oklahoma (Mmm)
Mine is comin' sooner (Mmm), I'm just a late bloomer (Mmm)
I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (Woo)
All these social networks and computers

I'm a livin' little good thing
It's like you never lived for me
Mama said you was a good thing, uh
Good, good, good
Yeah
We came a long way, man, we done came a long way
And we sittin' on top of this shit
This shit can go one or two ways
This shit can go up, it can go down
Either way, nigga, I'm prepared
Feel me? Yeah

I be comin' in peace, but f*ck me
Best beware of the others
This shit deep, undercovers creep
This Southern heat make unbearable summers
Just last week, seen your mama weep
Crying 'cause she don't wan' bury your brother
The blood leaks while the EMTs
Gotta carry her baby like surrogate mothers
Woah, thank God we survived around where the terrorists hovered
Though traumatized, wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Through hard times, it was there I discovered a hustle
And makin' the best out the struggle
I kept grindin' 'til this day, up a level
Respect mine, gotta stay out of trouble
'Cause TEC-9's like the AR rebuttals
Cole World, niggas knowin' what it is
Just in case they don't, I show 'em what it is
Then in summer, I do real numbers
Couldn't dare touch it if they sold the double disc
Block hot, niggas burnin' up the street
Shots poppin' and we heard it up the street
It's a war, niggas runnin' up the score
Jesus said that you should turn the other cheek
Voiceless niggas gettin' murdered every week
Dead bodies, smell the odor in the street
My homie' homie got out on parole
He sold more Coca-Cola than the soda industry
Summertime bring the coldest winter breeze
Hella blues like the Rollin' 60's
Christ went to Heaven aged thirty-three
And so did Pimp C and so did Nipsey

I told you, I told you
This shit can go up, it can go down, I don't give a f*ck
Nigga, I done seen the highest heights
I done seen it twice
And I've seen them lowest of the lows
And still I rose
Now I'm at your neck, nigga, yeah

And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, f*ck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough

All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
F*ckin' with you feel like jail, nigga

Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your-, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (Ah)

Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

Street life'll have you catchin' up to God quicker (yeah, gang)
Sticker, AK-40 to your liver
Let the chopper bang on you like a Blood or a Cripper (gang)

Made so much money off of dummies, off of dummies (yeah, gang)

I'm mister body catcher, Slaughter Gang soul snatcher
Ain't no regular F-150, this a f*ckin' Raptor

I'ma drop this shit and have these pussies droppin' like some motherf*ckin' flies
Type of nigga that can't look me in the eyes
I despise
When I see you, better put that f*ckin' pride to the side
Many times, plenty times, I survived
Beef is live, spoiler alert, this nigga dies

Keep blickies, and you know the weed sticky
My finger itchy, the Glock like to leave hickeys
Your shooters iffy, a street punk could never diss me

I'm on everything
Jacob charged me four-fifty for a tennis chain
US Open, had it on us at the tennis game
Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, and my men insane
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing
We in Paris with it, hundred carats with it
All this shit is for my son, 'cause he's inheritin' it

Told her at times I wanna give you trust but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside I'm a high roller
I been on a global jet but nigga I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick knacks
Fifty racks I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the Bach
I just f*cked off a million but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realist, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' Cat
She know I got the game but I'm never gon' give it back
Every time that we f*ck, I gotta run it back

I'ma treat you like I'm 'posed to

'Cause when I ride I'ma ride, ride with you

I told shorty never get too comfortable
I like to feel like the pussy untouchable
I like to feel like it's never goin' one way
I like to see your body drippin' Elliante
I say I like the way I took you on a wave
I had you screamin' my name out

Late at night
Kiss me in the mornin' or late at night
Long as you come through
I'ma make you come over and over

Godfather with a garden full of snakes

Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' by the Braves
Court room soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count money all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Teddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you f*cked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up

Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
"The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rondo"
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo

You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me

These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these is where my confessions live

Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothaf*ckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)

I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, "Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

I caught it bad just today
You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hoping I could catch you throwin' smiles at my face
Romantic talking? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to f*ck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't living right

Cocaine and drinking wit' your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way
Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name
I'll be on the way, like

Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buying
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from f*ckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh-oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I want to f*ck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinking wit' your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me in the morning
I'll be on the way
Call me when you want
Call me when you need
Call me out by your name

Ayy
You know my ex
So that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts
That you sent to yours but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say)

You walked in my life at 2 AM
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said

Now we're in the back seat of the black car going home
When she asked me, "Is it wrong if I come up with you?"
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

First off, I'm not sorry
I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible
Girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me
You text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please, don't say nothing at all, sounds so true to me
We don't have nothing to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love but I can't get enough of it

[J. Cole:]
Oh, you came there, God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Lord
No matter how, no matter how long it take, yeah
No matter how long it take, nigga
Oh, God, yeah
You better be

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (Spiral up)
No fly zone, please stay the f*ck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now they knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see nathin'
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prosper that's formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendys

[Morray & J. Cole:]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

[21 Savage:]
Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhf*cka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with them (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to textin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

[Morray & J. Cole:]
My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me

Mmh, mmh-mhm

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognize myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Don't you like me?
You know mommy doesn't like
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, um, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I don't know and I feel
Like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make you go, "Ay, yi, yi"

My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mmh, mmh-mhm

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and, and stuff like that to keep my mind off of it
And I feel like today, I'm home, and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up into a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that
But I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot

Funny now that you callin', that you ringin' my line
Why the hell is you ringin' my line?
Oh, I
Tell me what's changed, is it my status? Is it my fame?
Is it my pockets? Is it my change
Is it my pride? Is it my body?
Back then, "No show, no call" was your motto
Only hit me up after the club and you off that bottle
Pussy so good you thought you hit the lotto

I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong

What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You could come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Pop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I be on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimes I be wrong

I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hunnid rounds in a double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie and them to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around still, but I still check
I don't got a hunnid mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby f*ckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take real Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I f*ck her with my chains on
And she handle her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partnas, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, "Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me"
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me

Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

No me importa lo que de mí se diga
Vida usted su vida, que yo vivo la mía

It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started

When the nights get colder
And the rhythm's got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

There's always something that's standing in the way
But if you don't let it faze ya, you'll know just how to break
Just keep the right vibe, yeah, 'cause there's no looking back
There ain't no one to prove we don't got this on lock, yeah

The wait is over
The time is now, so let's do it right, mm
Yeah, we'll keep going (going)
And stay up until we see the sunrise (yeah)
And we'll say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
No, we don't need permission to dance
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na (hey)
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na
Da, na-na, na-na, na, na

Well, let me show ya
That we can keep the fire alive, mm
'Cause it's not over
'Til it's over, say it one more time
Say

I wanna dance, the music's got me going (music's got me going)
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move (hey), yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden (ooh)
And roll in like we're dancing fools (like we're dancing fools)
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land (we know how to land)
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight (ooh)
'Cause we don't need permission to dance

Copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like, "F*ck it, I'ma count while I'm in it"
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I've been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we f*ck she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential so they fear me
Lately, I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can you hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills but I know it ain't gon'

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy T-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just wanna leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Tryna explain your feelings sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the f*ck, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar, for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

Since a lil' youngin', I knew I would get me some money (skrrt)
Know I'd turn nothing to something, now look at your cousin (grrah)
The youngin', six million and runnin'
And I promise to keep it one hundred, keep it one hundred
You see me grindin' and hustlin'
So you got to respect me, f*ck you, give me my check, please (yeah, yeah)

Young and chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)

Hit him with pressure, my niggas won't let up
Tell them niggas to catch up, oh
Wake up, got a million in diamonds that sit on the dresser, oh
Run up that check, now I flexin' my muscles, I feel like a wrestler
'Cause we come from nothin' to Rollies and plaques
Fake love, it was holdin' him back
Flashbacks while you're pourin' the yak
Since a young nigga he just wanted a sack
He used to daydream 'bout thumbin' through racks
Heat tuck, it get cold in the 'Raq
Tears fall while he loadin' the strap
Seen it all, he just wanna relax, uh-uh
I'm richer than I ever been
Put my heart before the bag, worst shit I ever did
Gave you a second chance and you left again (uh)
'Member days I used to wonder, "Would we ever win?"

Young and chasin' dreams, reachin' for the stars (what else?)
Be all you can be, eat or you gon' starve (what else?)
A youngin' out that bottom, but he beat the odds (yeah, yeah)
I ain't gon' lie, I had it hard (yeah, yeah)

But now I'm richer than I've ever been (what else?)
I'm richer than I've ever been (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

So, I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I'll make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)

[Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?"
Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk
F*ck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to f*ck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', "Free Drizzy"
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit"
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi

[Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me"
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

[Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, wassup? We in this bitch

[Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still f*ck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
F*ck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya"
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green
6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

And my man in the can while you takin' out the trash, he gon' pop with the MAC like, "Don't run" (Don't run)
Gave her a pill, they all get high, you ever had a foursome?
It's too much cash for me to hide, I had to give lil' bro some
I f*ck her raw from time to time, I don't show no emotion
But when he died, he had them racks, he had to make a GoFund

The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't'

Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (yeah)

Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain

Your voice recording was enough
Uh, I should hang up, what am I doin'? Um
So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh
I miss you, I've been thinkin' about you
I've been thinkin' about our love and how much I miss your touch
I miss bein' around you, hearin' your laugh and holdin' your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doin' okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you crossed my mind
And I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi
So that's all, hi
And I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is gettin' long so I just say bye, but
The idea of you listenin' to this, the thought of you
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired (I can't hang up)
Goin' higher and higher and higher

Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches

When they gon' want me dead when I'm off probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?

You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
You said you do this all the time
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you wanted you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría

La luna está llena, mi cama vacía

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind

What you want to do
It's written all over your face times two
'Cause I can read your mind

I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
On repeat

Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before but we'll do it tonight
That afro' black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin looking at me like he know me

Let me find out and see, he coming over to me, yeah

You know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and weary
Like tell me there's life when I'm stressing at night
Be like you'll be okay and everything is alright, uh
Love me or nothin 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of ya brain

Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior

No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I'm orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it, still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?

My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, "Damn, I don't brag enough"
LVs, Double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain

Finally, finally, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?

Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we'd made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

Up, up, up (ayy) up, up
(This is fire) look

Once upon a time man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch, who nigga wanna f*ck on me
I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches f*cked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches f*cked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck huh
Up then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck huh

I could make the party hot
I could make your body rock
Bitches say they f*cking with me
Chances are they probably not
If I had a dick you probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speaking Capanese hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever popping shit
Pulling up and dropping shit
Gotta argue with him, 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playing gotta make him understand
If ain't no ring on my finger you ain't going on my 'Gram

I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches f*cked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches f*cked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh
Up then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh

Bitches ain't f*cking with me now and I can see why
Dirty ass, dusty ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch "That bad breath smell like horse sex"
Put it on him now, he will never be the same
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain
He nutted on my butt, I said "I'm glad that you came"
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches f*cked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches f*cked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh

(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

Missed out on my kids life for a year and I gotta accept it
Certain days, niggas never came to my shows and I felt neglected
Growin' up, seein' my uncle dyin' in his bed, that shit made me reckless
Pourin' up and I ain't never sharin' my meds and I ain't bein' extra
And I paid like two of my niggas bonds before I bought a necklace
I done seen my brother stack his bricks up and it look like Tetris
Have a real shootout up on the e-way, you can't miss your exit
Told the bitch she can't hide the smell of my cologne, she gotta go change her panties
Take care of your family and them kids 'cause I'm too big on family
F*ck them fast cars, before that shawty 'nem was gon' slide in Camrys
I'ma give my lawyer an extra dub because it come in handy
Felt like I'ma vomit off this Perc' 'cause I don't take no

Voice of the hero
I'm the voice of the hero
Voice of the hero
Voice of the hero
See, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero
Baby, he the hero
I'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero
But Baby, he the hero

I wasn't even tryna be no idol
I put niggas on, and all of the sudden they feel entitled
Put the barbers on 'em, you only get this kit when you got a title
I'm exhausted, I been workin' shift-to-shift, but I keep fightin'
Not my fault if I don't miss your likeness
And I'm still with Ced still
We the ones, for real, for real
I just got two hundred for a walk through, I'll still drill
High-speed chase in a Dodge Stratus, I can still peel 'em
I be tryna put on a smile for 'em but I don't really feel 'em
I just spent three-fifty on a Richard for the second time
I showed all my niggas in the trenches it's a better life
Never get too big for me to listen, I'll take your advice
I just told Durk, "We rich forever if we play it right"
Just keep on bein' the voice, I'll be the hero
And everything I got is a profit, started with zero
I can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from
And I'm just gettin' started, relax, wait 'til I warm up

I done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma
Everywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?
Police caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up
Ain't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up
Yeah, flood my system with these Perkies
Took the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirtin'
I just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin
All this shit these bitches textin' me, just do it in person
Yeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Perkies
Put the phone on DND, I'm somewhere, ain't no service
I just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it
I switch cars like bitches switch they purses
I slow down on features, I do verses if they worth it now
This shit done got deep and, let's be honest, we can't work it out
Peeped that lately you been actin' funny, wonder what it's 'bout
This shit really in me, hope you never doubt it, on gang

Voice of the hero
I'm the voice of the hero
Voice of the hero
Voice of the hero
See, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero
Baby, he the hero
I'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero
But Baby, he the hero

[Romeo Santos]
Tell me why you are throwing stones at the moon
As illogical as removing me from your skin
After God, I'm your everything, baby
How's it going with him?

[Romeo Santos & Bad Bunny]
I know in the end
You won't forget me not even a little bit
In the end, baby, you miss how I touch you
Remember, I know your body, mami
Every corner inside and out
Tell him that I came back for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bad Bunny & Romeo Santos]
I'm that tattoo, mami, that can't be erased
Without any nonsense, I'm not coming with sweet-talk
Tell that jerk that you always think of me
That when he finishes is whеn you are just starting
And that's when, that's when you feel thе difference
I always gave it to you with consistency
Tell him to give up, to do his due diligence
Because I came back for you
To do it to you really nice how you like it
Get on all fours and I'll hit it out of you like Tatís
You got in the Jeep and you didn't have panties
So don't deceive yourself
It's impossible that you don't miss me
Our relationship is for years, there's no way to damage it
With him you don't even sweat, you don't even have to shower after
After the sex with me, the bed sheets have to be thrown out
A towel for the girl so she can get dry
I don't want another, you're the one who knows how to make me climax
Today I came to rescue you (So nasty)

[Romeo Santos]
I know in the end
You won't forget me not even a little bit
In the end, baby, you miss how I touch you
Remember, I know your body, mami
Every corner inside and out
Tell him that I came back for you, yeah

[Romeo Santos & Bad Bunny]
How the f*ck is that jerk going to compare with me?
He doesn't even know you while I'm your crazy passion
I have the date written on my calendar
If I returned to Aventura, you come back to my side, baby
Make the hours count
It's his destiny, you and I have history
So that he sees that money isn't everything
I made you fall in love with my lust, I control
You know that that guy is temporary
Go, run off and tell him
You, say bye once and for all to that bastar- (Ay)

[Bad Bunny & Romeo Santos]
Because I came back for you
To do it to you really nice how you like it
Get on all fours and I'll hit it out of you like Tatís
You got in the Jeep and you didn't have panties
Because I came back, mami, for you
You do it with him, but thinking of me
Dissident with that unhappy fool
Hey, you end up with me

[Romeo Santos & Bad Bunny]
I know in the end
You won't forget me not even a little bit
In the end, baby, you get wet when I touch you
Remember, I know your body, mami (Ayy, ayy)
Every corner inside and out (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Tell him that I came back for you

[Bad Bunny & Romeo Santos, Both]
Bad Bunny, baby, baby
Bad Bunny, baby, baby
It's your turn, Romeo
Tell 'em
Aventura
You're mine, baby
You're mine, baby
We're going to do it again
We're going to do it again
You're mine, baby
You're mine, baby
We're going to do it again
Haha, ayy

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherf*cker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Lil Baby:]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
Dior my deleter, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I f*cked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out "YOLO," yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

[Drake:]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind

I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Ah, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet

Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been
Wasted on you

All of this time, and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time, and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you

It's like the sun went down just to frame your face
Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, making those tan lines

It's like the ocean knows we're laying
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waiting
For you to come alive 'cause

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita saltwater sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees

Boardwalks were made for dancing
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And, girl, I was made for you like

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over

Ayy, whoa
Ayy, ayy
Yeah

I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth
I can't just be with you and only you

Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been, whoa
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna f*ck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now we wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're selling your soul, okay
They want my life exposed
They wanna know about the highs and lows

Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy

Ayy, yeah
I got one, Lori bought one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been, whoa
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna f*ck up the wheels or f*ck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?

Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna f*ck a nigga lungs up
They be like, "Nardo, put them damn guns up"
F*ck that, say, big brother, bring them guns out
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, "What's happening?" Then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm like where they at? It ain't no fun out
7.62s, big as hell, knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four
Kick your door, get on the floor
Five, six, seven, eight
Don't make no noise, I'll eat your face
Nine, ten, eleven
We ain't gon' say that number, we don't f*ck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay (why?)
'Cause he blowin' niggas
I just got a brand new lolli'
That's a four nickel
Call me Nardo yes man
I don't know niggas
You could send your best man
You gon' lose your best hitta

What the f*ck is that?
What the f*ck is that?
That's how I step on niggas
(How I step on these bitch-ass niggas, bitch)

We step on shit like Craig daddy
We in the gym, no pep rally
Won't come outside, he scared probably
It deeper than a f*ckin' party
That don't matter (why?)
'Cause I'm gon' spray this bitch at everybody
I'm Nardo, bitch, I do magic
Turn his whip into a bastard
Take his life, he shouldn't have had it
I'm quick to snap just like my daddy
My nina rules, she kinda sassy
Let her go, she'll let you have it
Play you, lay you, try you down
I'm cold as hell, but I let off fire
Please don't try 'cause you gon' die
And I don't wanna see your mama cry
(Wakin' up, wakin' up, wakin' up, I'm wakin' up, wakin' up)

Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?

What the f*ck is that?
What the f*ck is that?

Loyalty over royalty, y'all niggas know the vibes

Bitch, I'm outside it's a movie
Blue cheese

Bitch, I'm 'bout my chicken like it's a two-piece
You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringing them gats out
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house
Off the 42, I'm blowing her back out
I'm back on my boss shit
Swing back with a full clip
They say I'm moving ruthless
And my shooters, they shooting
I don't shake 'til they roof criss
I get the breesh, then it's adiós
If I'm with your treesh then she's giving throat
When I see police, then we getting low

That's another piece, that's another Zoe
Ice in the VV's, now she's down to get treeshy
I got all this water on me, like Fiji
Bitch, I'm posted up with Hats and the Sleezys
Smokin' the Zaza, it goes straight to the matha
Then I'm uppin' the choppa
I'm hittin' the cha-cha, open his lata
Then he dancin' bachata

F*ck all of your reasons (Woah, woah)

"Yeah, I've kinda put the cup down for a minute, but, um
But honestly, it ain't nobodies business what's in my cup
What's in your cup, what's in their cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup
The only reaction I did was got more popular
More successful, did a lot more things that I've ever done
I probably should pick that cup back up"

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Kesha, like, do you love me? Do you love me not?
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (candy), sweet like fruit (ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and then I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she mine, I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peek-a-boo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station coffee cup full, I don't drive boats (nope)
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie, you get me higher than the prices of my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearin' them on my sleeves (see)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way, but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for f*ckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowin' I don't need you, pourin' O's in the liter
Sippin', chase it with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the Rosie, cup full of O-Z's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', "Pour me"
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (devil)
F*ck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground, love, we grown (too grown)
I'm too f*cked up, I pay four hunnid for a zone (that strong)
My bitch don't like you, you been f*ckin' up my home (in my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse)
Every nigga in the streets lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy with her, hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody, but it feel good to
Have somebody (that somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm (hmm)
I gotta stop it (I must stop it)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way, but some how we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like I'm dumb for f*ckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowin' I don't need you, pourin' O's in the liter
Sippin', chase it with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Oh nah, we don't do backpack
Haha, my pick up line and shit (come on)
I got your bitch movin' (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Call me when you get lost

Aw, you look malnourished (malnourished)
Let's get some bread, fry the egg yolk and drown it in syrup (drown it in syrup)
You pick a spot, I pick a tail number and we can be tourists (oh yeah)
Let's go to Cannes and watch a couple indie movies that you never heard of (baby)
Listen to bands, groove and we dance
Disco in France, smell some perfume, head in the wind (head in the wind)
We can switch off
I can show you how you can really exfoliate skin
If you got a man, you should cut it off
Get your passport 'cause we runnin' off (run off)
We can sit and talk
You can tell me everything that's on your chest, baby, get it off
You are my type, you a bright light
I'm like a moth, this is not a game (this is not a game)
But before we start (before I say)

What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)

Yeah

What is your name, what do you bring? (Yeah)
I think that I got what you need
And I'm willin' to do anything that you please (baby)
I'm tryna get down to the root of the apple
The deepest I could in them jeans
Mclaren, like Sonic, can't speed, no
No, you can't hit my lean, no (baby)
Baby, tell me where the peace go, 'cause I'm lost
Your body compared to the fashion
I hope you ain't proud of the shit that I bought (baby)
'Cause money, it don't mean a thing
I tell you the times that I take you out
One minute, it's a beautiful scene
Then it probably end with me bein' took off, whoa
Think slow, 'cause I move fast (oh, me)

What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Check it out)
(Oh, what's your name?)
What's your name, girlfriend, what's your name? (Tell me)

(You broke me first, oh)

Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself
But you should've told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple months, so you're calling me now

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly you're asking for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it

What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it

Pretty face, pretty tempted
But pretty taught me ugly lessons
Pretty had me givin' more than I was gettin'
So if pretty don't come with somethin', well, then I dead it
Ashamed to tell my friends how much I'd do for you
'Cause they know that you would never do the same for me
I wasn't lookin' for your secrets, they just came to me
And they contradicted everything you claimed to be
I took you to the club and you hugged on somebody that I know
And I know them type of hugs
Same shit I do to women when I know I used to f*ck
And I know they with they nigga, but they never brought it up
I'm down these days
Down to do better 'cause you know I done enough
You should lay it down, we'll talk about it when you up

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back, would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm

Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh
Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh)

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

Don't need no side dick, no

New attitude mixed with that pure raw (Aw)
The night game, your girl called
She like, "Do me, baby, down to get busy, busy?" (Yes)
No dice, chill, whoadie (No)
In life, feeling dizzy
Oh, having visions of the city and I go to war
See me in the day through the late night (Night)
Tell 'em it's the charm, I'm in freeze mode
To the gods, can't stop a hero when he in flight (Flight)
I'm swimming in the light right
Go and get you some, go and show 'em something, this a new thang
Yeah, I let my nuts hang (Yeah)
Knock your top off with LeBron or Dwyane Wade (Yeah)
Aww, lift off
Can't stunt a nigga growth, better get gone, move along (Uh)
You don't wanna trip, wanna get it on (Uh)
You don't wanna act, don't get me wrong (Nah)
They don't listen to the words in the song (Uh-huh)
We ain't gotta tell 'em, we just getting ready (Yeah)
See 'em fronting, we ain't kidding
If you want it, you can get it
Members of the rage, come and get you some
Next step's out the jet from the lean back
Running 'round the world and we ain't packed
Hit 'em, vroom, vroom, leave 'em stuck, oh, you seen that?
I'm chillin' where the team at
See a black Benz pull up with some jawns, yeah, I need that
So crazy, can't believe it
No cams, damn, no filming at all, real nigga facts (Come on)
Years ago, rehab
All good, helped me figure out another plan
It got bad, so bad
Nah, I ain't f*cking love that, man
Then I hopped out in a new zone with my Louis bag
True story, take you through the dark and the light (Yeah)
Godson, got through new
Back up in the world, it's the day in the life (Cud)
Hit the blunt and get it (Dude)
Raised bars (Uh), same song, we did it (Yeah)
Hot sauce, pour it on all jams, explicit
Carry on, smoke strong, got your mama down with it (Come on)
And the game f*ckin' needed something dirty raw
Tell them this the law and we weeded (Uh)

[Eminem]
So if it's God you believe in (Yeah)
Bob your head and just nod in agreement (Yeah)
They say time's undefeated
I'ma be the first one who can beat it (Yeah)
I had hoop dreams, now I shoot threes (What?)
Got a lil' green (Yeah), but I don't do weed (Nope)
Purp nor lean (Nah), that's Tunechi (Yeah)
That's New Orleans (What?), f*ck Drew Brees (Yeah)
Snoop D-O-double (Uh), that's two G's (Yup)
I probably spent on paper, ooh-wee
Since Tuesday, probably killed a few trees (Yeah)
But the only ones I smoke are the loose leaf
Not high, but I'm your highness (What?)
And secretly, you're on my dick (Hah)
But you haters are butthurt (Ow), bunch of sore hind-ends (Ow)
I was just a poor white kid (Yeah)
Now if rap was B-ball, I'd be Jordan-like, bitch (What?)
You wish you could score like this (Nah), yeah
Not even at half court, I'd miss (Nah)
I'm mouthwash, 'cause if I was on the floor, I'd swish (Fluoride, fluoride, swish)
But I cannot lie (Nah)
I got you in my top five
Worst rappers of all time (Hah)
I lost my spot, y'all got Alzheim' (Uh)
King of rap? Nah, their words, not mine (Yeah)
King of swear words and not lying (Yeah)
You should never compare yours (Nope)
A toll-free number (Yeah), only way you'll ever have a hot line
F*ck's going on, man? (Yeah)
Bunch of half-wits up in office (What?)
Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse
Other half are just pissed off and (Yeah)
Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing
And that's how you end up catching the shit off 'em
I just used the same basket as you shopping
Now I'm in a f*ckin' casket from you coughin' (Damn)
Always stay ahead of haters, let 'em hate
But never let a traitor penetrate your circle
Separate yourself from those who try to pull you down
The real ones never stray, it's sort of like Medusa (Yeah)
That's how you stay ahead of snakes (Woo)
Emcees pull out gats, I don't give a f*ck how strapped
You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming (Yeah)
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music (Nah)
Running through ink like I'm tattooing (Yeah)
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as f*ck
And it's nonstop fury (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery (Nah)
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried (Nah)
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery (Yeah)
How the f*ck is it that so many cops are dirty? (Huh?)
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery (F*ck)

[Kid Cudi]
The adventures of Moon Man & Slim (Ah)
Yes, who want it with them?
The trilogy continues
Serving niggas, yes, see what's on the menu (Yeah)
Watch 'em panic, hot damnit (Let's get it, baby)
Hope you f*ckers understand it
The realer for you niggas
Come and get these scriptures (Yeah)
Rap God (Uh)
Rager

Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)
Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia, don't leave, oh
Talk to me, without you I can't breathe

My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

Never comin' down, uh
I was runnin' away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
They said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)
Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no

I get up, I get down and I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge, still I'm not feelin' grown
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to go
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
(Here we go)

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)

Feel like I'm gonna puke 'cause my taxes are due
Do my password begin with a one or a two?
Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to grow
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
(Metronome)
Man, I'm up to something (up to something), ooh-dee-la-dee-doh
Thank you all for comin' (all for coming), I hope you like the show
'Cause it's on a budget, so ooh-dee-la-dee-doh
Yeah, come on here we go, yeah, come on (here we go)

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try, so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) (Bang! Bang-bang)
(Bang! Bang! Bang!) (Bang! Bang-bang! Bang! Bang!)

Been a hell of a ride but I'm thinkin' it's time to go

So put your best face on, everybody
Pretend you know this song, everybody
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
(Bang! Bang! Bang!)

Come hang (come hang)

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind

You throw tantrums while I'm twisting up
No medicine is fixing us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinking

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that

I cross the seas with you (ayy)
Wasn't even supposed to be with you (yeah)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you
And I could keep you nice and warm
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love
If I was to give you the world (yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (yeah)

Got too much going to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back
It hurts sometimes it be like that

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that

Sometimes when you thought you found the love of your life
Now you're thinking I'm just one of those guys leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong

Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why, but tell you what
You got me thinking

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

Sometimes when you're falling off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry
'Cause we're both just out of our mind, yeah

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, some can heal, but this won't

So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Protests and growin' national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherf*cker up)
Last night, people protestin' in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
F*cked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grievin'
They killin' us for no reason
Been goin' on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the f*ck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judgin' by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
F*cked up, the way that we livin' is not gettin' better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they goin' outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind followin' the blind
Thinkin' 'bout everythin' that's goin' on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the mornin', he wakin' up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowin' we needed help, they neglect us
One of them who gon' make them respect us
'Cause I can see in your eye that you fed up
F*ck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight (nah)
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

F*ck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losin' our country
But we gotta stand up for somethin', so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lyin' if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speakin' for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killin' and dope, but I'm tellin' my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight (nah)
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protesters with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathin' the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
F*ck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight (nah)
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight (nah)
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, though we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good

Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (yeah)

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Yeah, ooh

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm fallin'

You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you fallin'?

Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?

I wonder when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection

I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Perignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke "well, it's made for me" how
Evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
Till someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's f*cked in the head", they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
And you won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as get Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

Whoa
Uh
Oh
(Mello made it right)

I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as bein' nothin'
I try to be everything that I can
But sometimes I come out as bein' nothin'
I pray to God that He make me a better man, uh
Maybe one day, I'ma stand for somethin'
I'm thankin' God that He made you part of the plan
I guess I ain't go through all that Hell for nothin'
I'm always f*ckin' up and wreckin' shit, it seems like I perfected it
I offer you my love, I hope you take it like some medicine
You tell me, ain't nobody better than me, I think that there's better than me
Hope you see the better in me, always end up betterin' me

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

We take drugs, then you hold me close
Then I tell you how you make me whole
Sometimes, I feel you like bein' alone
Then you tell me that I shoulda stayed in the room
Guess I got it all wrong, all along, my fault
My mistakes probably wipe all the rights I've done
Sayin' goodbye to bygones, those are bygones
Head up, baby, stay strong, we gon' live long

I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go
I don't wanna ruin this one
This type of love don't always come and go

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah
I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days

I don't know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But you know that I'm not perfect

I been praying for forgiveness
You've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth
Hoping you'll find someone else

'Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family
Watch your husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven
So I see you once again

My life was kinda short
But I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine
It sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy)
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)

I'm happy that you're here with me
I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger
You would always make me cheer up

Taking goofy videos
While walking through the park
You would jump into my arms
Every time you heard a bark

Cuddle in your sheets
Sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays went to church
On Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone
Sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Hey, mamma, how do you get a red-wine stain out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillow case
Cure a one-too-many headache
Mamma, can I come and maybe stay a few days?
This weekend or next
And hey, how do you get a red-wine stain out of your favorite dress?

How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask daddy if he's got time to come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything and keep that pistol in the drawer
Mamma, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, broken heart

Can your knees give out from praying so hard?
Can you go blind from crying in the dark?
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?

How does he sleep at night?
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?

She like the way I (err)

I was a third string dreamer on a second place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe (average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Yeah, it does to me
That might not mean much to you

But it does to me
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

(Don't, don't, don't)
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)

Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (oh)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
Don't start caring about me now (so)

Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (so)
Oh, oh
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feeling ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Tear me up inside, and you break me down

Wait a minute, who are you? (Ayy, yo, K.I.D)

I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga
I f*ck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart, tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song

Ooh, I know the feelin', ain't it? (Okay)
You ever feel the way I feel, you know it feel amazin' (let's go)
I had this bitch, we used to kick it, she was feelin' baby (mwah, mwah, mwah)
She stepped on my heart, had me feelin' basic (damn)
You know how people like to come back when you level up (uh-huh)
I made a change, you stayed the same, I got ahead of ya
Plus I been tryin' to free up some time in my schedule, but (uh-huh)
When opportunity knockin', I never say no
'Cause I been busy catchin' them blessings I used to pray for (let's go)
Stackin' up the back-end like Tetris, we playin' Legos
And every day I pray to God that a nigga don't try to play, though
'Cause I don't like to play, be done gave a nigga a halo (boom, boom, boom)
I'm thinkin' 'bout the people I lost, know I got some angels
Chillin' with my freak, when we f*ckin', it ease my anger
I'm takin' selfies with my bitch, she keep switchin' up different angles
And no, I never kept a bitch, but I always keep me a banger (boom, boom, boom)

I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (ah)
I f*ck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart, tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song

Ooh, I let her ride again
She spread her legs and open up, I end up slidin' in (okay)
She know the shit excitin', you is not excitin' him (me)
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin (yup)
He know to come look where I'm at, he wanna find his bitch (she with me)
Know I'm aggressive, when she kiss me, like to bite her lip (grr)
I don't be makin' love songs, they don't excite a jit (no)
Real nigga, I got feelings, (yeah) I'm not hiding it (okay, let's go)
Still pimpin', tell the bitch I really like her friend (yeah, bitch)
You know her pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly her in (yeah, bitch)
If I speak once, she don't respond, I won't say hi again (bitch)
She catch me once and let me slide, I never lie again (let's go)
My name not Melly, I got murder on my mind again (uh-huh)
I'm with the shits, I'd kill him twice if he could die again
And if he think 'bout tryin' me, he better try again
'Cause I'ma let 'em spin, if he don't drop, then we gon' slide again

I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga (ah)
I f*ck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero

Million cash plus whenever I go re-up

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Post Malone]
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

[Justin Bieber & Post Malone]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Clever]
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But heaven knows that that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

After all

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby "The

If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (ayy, ayy)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em, "Lick the balls"
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster (ayy)
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherf*ckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) yeah
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherf*ckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherf*ckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Mark Jack)

Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the f*ckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
Or being the recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherf*cker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to f*ckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull the

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleaning, I'm always too busy dreaming
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing
Yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone
But it ain't stealing
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today

Maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
'Stead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time, I don't even know what I'm saying it about

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh, it make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't, I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah, it's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
Heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh, it make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waiting on the other side
I'm always wondering if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waiting
That there's a whole lot more for me waiting
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad
Ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad
At least it don't gotta be no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey
Mm, hey, mm

I said, "Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?"
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

Never fallin', why you makin' problems?

Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me


While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go (shawty on go, go, yeah)
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red on the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae

If I hit it from the back, she gon' hit the sidewalk
If she got a best friend with her, take her back to my loft
Got her five in the mornin', wildin', wildin'
And her name ain't Megan but she a stallion, stallion
Never keep my hoes divided, 'member I was pullin' up in the Valley
And you know I take her soul when she ridin'
Sweater and her sneakers all Kenzo
Shawty know to drop it low like a limbo every time we kick it like Timbo, woah, woah, woah

Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause (nah, nah)
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart (ooh-ooh)

Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah

Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I, I hope she makes you smile
The way it made me smile
On the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone

Oh baby I
I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah babe, I hope she
Shows up in a 2AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope it goes, comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I'll forget about them
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by

I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry

Brand new whip just hopped in (just hopped in)

I could pass that bitch like Stockton (it ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (mmh, mmh)
Sportscenter, top ten

I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (he a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (she do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?" (It does)
Certified freak ho, hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw, goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's (cha-ching)

But she don't put this on the 'Gram (nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (ay)

Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (hit that shit)

This where my head is (listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (that's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (nah)

I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, f*ck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I f*ck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these muthaf-ckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'm a ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'm a have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasing, tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these f*ck niggas, so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I f*ck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?
Gunna

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just
A cannibal
And I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
I won't sleep tonight

Take a bite of
My heart tonight

Say goodbye to my heart

Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run
And hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be
Denied by you
The animal inside of you

Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh

Oh oh

Hush, hush We both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight

We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh, but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
"Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
"Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said, "Say I do"
I did and you did too, then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
"Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

Yeah baby, I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life, tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burning in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time.

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time.

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer
All the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time.

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.

I miss your tan skin
Your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it, but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time

A full moon shinin' bright
Edge of the water; we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold

Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna grow up
(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down
(Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
(Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right
(Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive
(Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna grow up
(Whoa-oh)
Never gonna slow down
(Whoa-oh)
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
(Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right
(Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive
(Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

Whoa-oh, never gonna grow up
Ha!
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
(Whoa-oh)
We were doin' it right
(Whoa-oh)
We were comin' alive
(Whoa-oh)
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, barefoot, blue jean night

(Whoa-oh)
Barefoot, blue jean night

There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong

Goes around, comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now

[Lily Allen:]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping and I was hoping...

[T-Pain:]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it
Cause you've been waiting on me since
I said that I was hittin' the club
Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on
She might come and find me
And then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Hook: Lily Allen]

[T-Pain:]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
"What is he doing? " oh what is he doing?
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
You texting me like I'm a kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And you do know what time it is

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
On my bed, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin
And I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night and then
We always wake up singing the same song

[Wiz Khalifa:]
You ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to
Leave here with one of them
That's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4: 30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib...
(It's 5â²o Clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom
Flooring to the dresser
Don't want nothing less cause I'm sure you're the best
You're the one, So I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like "damn, babe you woke me up"
I like you way you put it down likes it's for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drown in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to
Love...but you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntan
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drown in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say goodbye

Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone,
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow.

One step closer

[Chorus:]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

One step closer

[Chorus:]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

One step closer
One step closer

[Chorus:]
I have died everyday waiting for you
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view (view)
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (shoot)
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true,
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

[Chorus:]
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't know what city I'm in at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last november, now december's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong

[Chorus:]
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it
Let em talk, let em talk, let em talk, let em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let em walk, let em walk, let em walk, let em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
Cause they be swallowing it

[Chorus:]
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home

No one hold me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let's go

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

[Chorus:]
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home.

Back, back, in, in, time

Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

Miami equals black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker won't cha
Give credit where credit is due don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time

Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time

Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one

Let's excuse me baby
Go, yeah you baby
Back, ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby

White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw, I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope, tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold,
But there's nothing to grasp so I let go

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a shit day (NO!)
Have you had a shit day? (NO!), we've had a shit day (NO!)
I think that life's too short for this, I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.

I won't miss all of the fighting that we always did,
Take it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick whiskey dick, no more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick, 'cause you'll no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a shit day (No!)
Have you had a shit day? (No!), we've had a shit day (No!)

[Not in the music video version:]
Na na na na - da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please, anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe, I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear
All the lies, all the why's, will all be crystal clear

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weather man called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus:]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'til there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away

She heard those sirens screaming out
Her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screaming of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

[Chorus:]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away,
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'til there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,
Blown away

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away (blown away)
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away (blown away)
'til there's nothing left standing,
Nothing left of yesterday (blown away)
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away,

Blown away, blown away, blown away, blown away

This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow
In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on a Patron
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, call me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, oh oh
I don't even think you know, no no

See I've been waiting all day

Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like a gold with a view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time
Uh-oh

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright, if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who ist Taylor Swift anyway? Ew")
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time
Uh-oh

(Hey) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (uh-uh-uh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two
(Uh, ah-ah-ah uh) twenty-two
I don't know about you
twenty-two
twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Uh-uh, uh-uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright, if (uuh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright, if
We just keep dancing like we're twenty-two
Uh-oh, oh, oh twenty-two
(Dancing like) twenty-two
Yeah, yeah, twenty-two, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Verse 1:]
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an I.V., baby could I bear
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)

(A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E) Make it real loud

[Verse 2:]
I've overheard your theory "nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture in me

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on)

[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us is rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
So let's neglect the "what if"'s and make it do what it does
Let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I have some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to f*ck

[Verse 1: Wale]
Let's get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
Cause I heard you (bad no), yeah.
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love you
But to kiss them saying you mean that (bad no)
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling it's something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I can see the ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was going for the morn, hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Let me tell you about her look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you winter time cold, shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach how they court you
All those minds games never mind cause they all lose (bad no)
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working with deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning cell number wasn't on, goddamn

[Intro: Mariah Carey]
Ah, ah, you're beautiful
(Yeah)
Ah, ah, you're beautiful

[Verse 1: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again

[Hook: Miguel]
You're beautiful, and your mind is f*cking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, you're f*cking beautiful
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I like when you run red lights
Don't stop 'til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don't know
But I don't care, take me anywhere
'Cause it's beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I can't pretend that doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Hook: Miguel & Mariah Carey]

[Outro]
Ohh-oo-ohh, ohh-oo-ohh (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Yeah Yeah (ah, ah, so beautiful)
You don't know what you're doing darling, noo-ohh (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Hop on back my bike darling, Ohh I take you (ah, ah, so beautiful)
Oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, oh-oh-ah, ah-ah-ah...[x2]

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all about you,
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
Cause...

[Beat break]

Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock (eh, eh, eh)
Take a bow, you're on the hottest ticket now (eh, eh, eh)

[Nicki Minaj]
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'mma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go, let's go)
Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock

Cause all I need
Is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete

[Verse 1:]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-aag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, oh that's my pigment
Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Bridge:]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(Go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(Go berserk) all night long

[Hook:]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say f*ck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk) Grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, Bawitdaba, dang-dang
Pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...

[Bridge]

[Hook II:]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
I say f*ck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk) Get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3:]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a-loan (car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shit head with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Maybe it's the way she walked (wow)
Straight into my heart and stole it.
Through the doors and past the guards (wow),
Just like she already owned it.

I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh

Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it.

I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams."

And we danced all night to the best song ever.
We knew every line. Now I can't remember

Then, honey you're not there when I'm

Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it if you get with me

Cause tonight it's going down, yeah you know it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop

You can't keep your hands off me, touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you, your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started

Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it, I want it all the time
Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it, I'm on you, I'm on you

The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh.

Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night; what? (That's right)
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your 4 wheel drive (A country boy can survive)

Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck

Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?) No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Let me hear you say
(Ooh let's ride)
(Ooh let's ride)
Down to the river side

(Ooh let's rideâ¦)
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town
Have you ever got down with aâ¦
Red red red red red red redneck?
And do you wanna get down with aâ¦
Red red red red red red redneck?
Girl you gotta get down

With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

(Ooh let's ride)
Red red red red red red redneck
(Ooh let's ride)
I'm one of them boys 'round here
(Ooh let's ride)
Red red red red red red redneck
(Ooh let's ride)

(Ooh let's rideâ¦)
Well all I'm thinkin' 'bout is you and me, how we'll be
So come on girl, hop inside
Me and you, we're gonna take a little ride
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town
Girl you gotta get down with aâ¦
Come on through the country side
Down to the river side

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there,
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing,
Bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good,
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
